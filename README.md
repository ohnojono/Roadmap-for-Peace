## Table
Table top dimensions required: **360(l) x 244(w) x 70(h) cm**

#### Now Play This table
Original plans were to build a large gallery style plinth, however logistically this was difficult for Now Play This (NPT) exhibition. 

Sophie Sampson of NPT designed and fabricated three tables each at 120(l) x 244(w) x 70(h) cm. Using 25mm box welded steel frame and 18mm plywood tops. The third section has a 2.5m high end steel section to mount banner. Photos for reference to follow.

There was an Ikea Kallax single shelving unit with a Kallax insert door attached underneath the table top on one side to hide power blocks and some wiring.

Holes were drilled through the plywood top to hide trailing wires. Any non essential Scalextric parts/systems were hidden inside the shelf under table.
