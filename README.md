### 1. Track Design
[Various track designs](Track%20Design) for consideration. The final version submitted was the *"RMFP-track-a"* version. Image exports of this track can be found [here](Image%20Exports/a).
#### Design Software used

- **[RailModeller Pro](http://www.railmodeller.com/home-railmodeller.html)** - to open the .layout files.

**[RailModeller Express](http://www.railmodeller.com/express-edition-en.html)** (free version) may also open the files to view, but will likely not allow editing or exporting.

These original designs and parts list by Jono Sandilands were sent to Thomas Hall of [The Racing Room](http://www.theracingroom.co.uk/), Nottingham who supplied track hire, delivery and setup. There are some expected alterations to be made to the track by Thomas who will supply updated track specs.

#### Track Spec
We opted for modern Scalextric Digital track and cars due to the nature of the track layout, splitting into different lanes etc.

The design is made with the [Scalextric C7042 Digital Advanced Powerbase](https://www.scalextric.com/uk-en/scalextric-digital-advanced-6-car-powerbase.html) unit. 

The experience is designed for 2 cars in use at one time. We opted for Audi TT cars - kinda familiar (more) everyday car type.

## Table
Table top dimensions required: **360(l) x 244(w) x 70(h) cm**

#### Now Play This table
Original plans were to build a large gallery style plinth, however logistically this was difficult for Now Play This (NPT) exhibition. 

Sophie Sampson of NPT designed and fabricated three tables each at 120(l) x 244(w) x 70(h) cm. Using 25mm box welded steel frame and 18mm plywood tops. The third section has a 2.5m high end steel section to mount banner. Photos for reference to follow.

There was an Ikea [Kallax single shelving unit](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/storage-furniture/shelving-units-systems/kallax-shelving-unit-white-art-20301554/) with a [Kallax insert door](https://www.ikea.com/gb/en/products/storage-furniture/shelving-units-systems/kallax-insert-with-door-white-art-20278167/) attached underneath the table top on one side to hide power blocks and some wiring.

Holes were drilled through the plywood top to hide trailing wires. Any non essential Scalextric parts/systems were hidden inside the shelf under table.
